# NotasRapidas 📝

A simple and quick note-taking web application.

## 🚀 About the Project
I created this project to practice and reinforce my skills in **Vanilla JavaScript**. The main goal was to understand how to persist data in the browser without a backend database.

### Key Concepts Practiced:
* **JavaScript Logic:** DOM manipulation, Event Listeners, and Array methods.
* **LocalStorage:** Saving, retrieving, and deleting data so notes persist after page refresh.
* **Tailwind CSS:** Used for quick and responsive styling.
